# Agentic AI Video Summarizer Project
<br/>

The project is a web application built using **Streamlit**, which allows users to upload  videos and analyze their content using custom prompts, and also has a translation feature.
<br/>

1. **phi**: I have used this library to import AI Agent framework, Google Gemini model and DuckDuckGo search tool.
2. **google.generativeai**: Used for utility functions like 'upload_file' and 'get_file'.
3. **deep_translator**: Used to import **GoogleTranslator** fro translation properties.
4. I used **Google AI Studio** to create the API Key for using the Gemini model.

The current project is a basic and simple looking one. It was my first attempt at building an Agentic AI application, but I find this very interesting and will continue exploring and building complex, beautiful and useful applications!
